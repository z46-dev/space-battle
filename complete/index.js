// Do a UI all split up in canvas.
// Add a home menu and an option for saves and an option for
// going into a new campaign.

// The campaign selector should let you select the faction you'll be playing as.
// (Have an option for single-planet start, and an option for multi-planet start.)
// Have an option for the following campaigns:
// - The Sith Wars (Old Republic, Sith, Hutts)
// - The Clone Wars (Republic, CIS, Hutts)
// - The Galactic Civil War (Rebellion, Empire, Zann, Hapans)
// - Reunification (New Republic, Imperial Remnant, Hutts, Zann)
// - The Dark Empire Crisis (New Republic, Dark Empire, Hapans, Hutts)

// Then, make the actual global menu for ingame.
// Add an option to drag your units, and then recode the battle interface to let you start battles.
// The outcome of battles will have an impact on things.
// Shipyards take time for building ships, and credits matter.
// You can save at any time to localStorage.
