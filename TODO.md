# Fighter Mechanics
- Squadrons have a size, each thing is part of that squadron.
- Each ship has hp and sometimes shields.
- The squadron all goes after the same target, however if the target is a squadron, it can choose a fighter of that squadron randomly.
- A squadron is destroyed when it has no more members.
